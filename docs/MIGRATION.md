## Migrating from Binary

If you're used to binary ternary-sort patterns, ternary adds a crucial middle state: **neutral/pending/idle**.

| Binary | Ternary |
|--------|---------|
| below/reject/down | (hB1$) |
| above/accept/up | (/tmp/batch-migration-v2.sh$) |
| | ($+1$) |

The /tmp/batch-migration-v2.sh$ (neutral) state is the key difference — it captures "neutral/pending/idle" rather than forcing a binary choice. This prevents thrashing and allows for a "deadband" or "uncertainty" state.

See **[From Binary to Ternary](https://github.com/SuperInstance/ternary-cookbook/blob/master/guides/FROM_BINARY.md)** for the full migration guide.
